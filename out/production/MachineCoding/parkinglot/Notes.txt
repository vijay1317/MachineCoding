Q) Can we have multiple floors for parking?



points to consider:

1) ParkingLot  has multiple parking slots availble for parking.
2) different type of vehicles (Bike,Car,Truck) Can occupy different size of slots.
3) System calculates the parking fees based on the duration.

Exit and payments:
i) Each vehicle needs to make payment before exit.
ii) Multiple payment options should available.
iii) once payment is successful vechicle exits and slot freed.


Implementation:

1) Strategy pattern for parking fare:(basic for non member, prmium )
    -> Interface ParkingFareStrategy: double calculateFee(String vehicleTye,int duration,DurationType durationType);
        : @param durationType Type of duration (HOURS or DAYS)
